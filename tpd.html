                <p>Intercultural communication helps individuals in the professional sphere to understand <br>
                     and respect individuals that have different cultural affiliations;<br>
                      to respond appropriately, effectively and respectfully when interacting and communicating with such individuals; <br>
                      to establish positive and constructive relationships. <br>
                    Intercultural communication plays a huge role in effective communication,<br>
                     and this is because we are all different, <br>
                     it is important to recognise each other's communication manners, <br>
                     and then learn to have awareness of other people’s culture, and ours.<br>

            <p>In the Public Relations and Advertising field, there is always a huge emphasis on intercultural research. <br>
                This is because culture affects everything including advertisements, and when working with people across different backgrounds, <br>
                 it is crucial to be aware of cultural differences. If a brand creates an advertising message for people, and it violates certain practices <br>
                  in the culture, the brand suffers hostility. For instance, if a body wash brands disseminates an advertising message that shows a half naked woman, <br>
                   no one will ever patronise them. Yes, it is patriarchy, but it is their culture,<br>
                    and as outsiders we have zero or little impact on their culture.

            <div class="text"></div>
            <p>A vivid intercultural experience I encountered in my course is the fact that most Chinese people generally like to distance themselves from people, <br>
                 and stick with people from their country, and people who understand their language.<br>
                  I did not realise this until I spoke Mandarin to them, and not long after then, they started including me in most of their conversations.<br>
                   Another person would see this as a “snobbish” attitude, and would not understand that it is how they act.<br>
                Intercultural communication offers the ability to deal across cultures, which is increasingly important, as the world gets smaller. <br>
                
                Intercultural communication is so crucial because each employee’s unique background, life experiences and skillsets influence their work performance. <br>
                Inclusive companies have been proven to be nearly two times more more innovative than other companies thanks to the multiple perspectives of their employees.

   <p>Public relations and advertising is mainly about promoting humans, brands, and everything promotable. <br>
    In the public relation field, is it important to go out to network, and promote oneself, <br>
     because it is when you promote yourself excellently that prospective clients think you would do a great job at promoting their brands.<br>
     I am learning to better promote myself, and articulate my hard-earned  skills in professional environments.<br> 
    The Fintech community relies heavily on networking and individual introductions. <br> This means that someone looking to get into that space needs to be well grounded and articulate in communicating their skills and experiences <br>
    when the time and situations call for it. </p>

    <p>Odun Eweniyi, CEO of PiggyVest said in tweet said that she landed her Fintech investor <br>
        when she was still working at a bank. She gave a one minute elevator pitch, and got funding for her idea. This means I always have to be ready to network, and I must practice it daily. <br>
        I chose the course on setting and running a business because it is one of my greatest fears, and I am very scared of failing.<br>
         Taking this course has made me feel more equipped to start thinking of business ideas,how to execute them, <br>
         and tips on avoiding common mistakes.

<h4>Project Management</h4>
<p>Project Management is very important in all spheres, contextually, public relations.<br>
     In Public Relations, people/organisations undergo PR Campaigns. PR campaign is a series of planned activities that all have a specific purpose and are working towards the same goal for a business. <br>
     PR campaigns always have clear objectives and usually have a fixed time frame to them. <br>
    In order for a PR campaign to be successful, it has to undergo series of planning, and employ project management skills such as:<br>
     defining, planning, designing, implementing, testing and acceptance.<br>

<h4>Problem Solving and Decision Making</h4>
<p>
    Most problems encountered in Public Relation is injured reputation.
     It is the duty of a PR specialist to fix it. <br>
     When attempting to fix a damaged reputation, or hostility of a community towards a brand or product, the first thing to do is to identify the problem.<br>
      I once read a case study on a community that was hostile to a beverage brand,<br>
       and how the hostility was turned into acceptance.

        <h2 class="ptitle"> PERSONAL REFLECTION </h2>
       <h3> While many believe that money makes the world go round, and others think that love makes the world go round,<br>
         I have come to appreciate the gift and essence of communication, because, indeed it makes the world go round.<br> 

        At the inception of this course, I did not regard myself as an excellent communicator <br>because I barely paid attention to people, and communication was a one way thing for me, as opposed to two;<br>
         forgetting that attention is the core foundation that communication is built on.<br> During the course of my study, I learnt more about the 7-38-55 rule,<br>
          which has helped me gain more clarity in communicating, especially in professional settings. <br>
           Now, I’m better at expressing my dissatisfactions in polite, and disagreeing professional ways. <br>
           I’m better equipped to get into the professional world, because of skills derived from this course.<br>
        
        I’ve never really worked in a professional environment, so I did not have a broad understanding of the DOs and DON’Ts of the workplace. <br>
        Picking this choice was a great idea for me because I learned about my rights at the workplace, and laws that protect me. I’m a black, bisexual woman, from a third world country, and discrimination almost feels inevitable.<br>
         I also learned about English managers and the workplace, and how they react to certain situations, <br>
         this way, my transition from the university, into the real world would be smooth, and almost hassle-free.<br>

        
        I have always been terrified of starting businesses. Nearly all my friends have small businesses except me.<br>
         I am terrified of failure. Managing a business is overwhelming, and I felt I was better off selling business to people. <br>
         Learning about steps to starting a business has encouraged me to take a leap, to start a business, and make profit off things I am excellent at.<br>
          I also learnt a whole lot about budgeting, which is something I’m not perfect at, intellectual property laws, segmentation, pricing laws, and so many. I feel empowered, and more equipped than ever.
        
        
        To be honest, I have never been excellent at networking and promoting myself, because of imposter syndrome. Sometimes I feel I am not as competent as others perceive me to be, and I doubt all of my skills and abilities. But lately, I have been trying really hard to recognise my accomplishments, and appreciate all the work I have done, to get to where I am. I practise networking with my friends, so when I am out, especially in professional settings, I speak about my potentials, proudly. I was recently on a zoom call the Talent Team at my faculty set up, and we were asked to introduce ourselves. I told over a hundred people that I am a web developer, and a writer, and an advertising intern. I felt great. I indeed love how this course teaches me not to wallow in my fears, instead, I embrace them, and do better. I can certainly say that I am a better networker than I was, before I took this course.
        
        Last year, when I was an undergraduate, it was compulsory, and I had no choice. I didn’t take it serious, no one did, because I consider (ed) myself a smart ass that could pass excellently, even without studying so hard. I passed with an A. But I have come to the realisation that it’s more than passing. It is understanding how things get done, how things could go wrong in a project, and building plans in place to ensure the smooth running of a project. This course has made me reflect on little projects I undertook in the past, that did not go as planned. Now, I’m better equipped to take on projects, because I have learned valuable skills that would enable the smooth running and success of the projects.

                   One I found interesting is the fact that we both have experiences in Project Management,<br>
                    and it was not difficult navigating the course. However, while reading his learning outcomes, <br>
                    I realized I personalised my answers in regard to my past experiences, current endeavours, <br>
                    and target career; something that was not so present in his answers.

                     but it’s enlightening to know that we both experiences in this area, <br>
                     and we share same ideas on how leadership is more about motivation, types of leaders, <br>

                     that he wants to go into academia, and he has thought about how he can transfer this information to a research environment.

                 and how it makes things come to existence, how it makes things go round. <br>
                 Kaiming wrote and I quote “Without a friendly way of communication, conflicts may arise with team members,<br>
                  slowing down the work process. This is why the design management profession requires a very good communication skill."
                  <br>
                
                I think it is incredible how it was linked to their course,<br>
                 because in design management, just like every other field, one needs to communicate with everyone; stakeholders, employees, consumers e.t.c to know what they want.

<p>A similarity I found in our works on the Transnational Communication point is excellent. <br>
     We both have stories we have heard about or witnessed where an organisation did not communicate with the target consumers properly, <br>
     and they ended up creating the wrong products for them, which created hostility between the two parties. <br>

    Kaiming suggests that we all require crosss-border expertise, in order to have smooth relationships <br>
     with everyone.
    Although, I feel as though Kaiming did not focus attention on the transnational employees, just the consumers.
